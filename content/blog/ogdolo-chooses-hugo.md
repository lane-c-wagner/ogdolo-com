## Ogdolo Chooses Hugo


We started Ogdolo to help small businesses create their marketing websites the way they should be:

* Fast
* Static
* Inexpensive
* Beautiful

### Speed

Hugo is fast. Really fast.

With hugo we can generate static sites in less than one second. This means we can be more efficient in our
design and deployment processes, which keeps costs down.

### Themes

Hugo has a rich community of users that create beutiful themes for the Hugo framework. Using theme templates
allows us to stay streamlined and focus more on what we do: Helping our clients create and host a website that
gets them the customers they need.
